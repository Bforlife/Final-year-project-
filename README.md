# Observed Changes in the Cerebellum of Male Wistar Rats Co-Exposed to High Fat Diet and Bisphenol-A Using Allogarft Inflammatory Factor 1 And Routine Stainning Techniques

## Overview

This repository contains the data, analysis scripts, and documentation for my final year project: **"Observed Changes in the Cerebellum of Male Wistar Rats Co-Exposed to High Fat Diet and Bisphenol-A Using Allogarft Inflammatory Factor 1 And Routine Stainning Techniques"**.

 The project investigates the neurobiological effects of simultaneous exposure to a high fat diet and Bisphenol-A (BPA) on the cerebellum of male Wistar rats.

## Objectives

- To assess morphological and histological changes in the cerebellum following co-exposure.
- To compare the effects of high fat diet, BPA, and their combination.
- To analyze potential neurotoxic interactions between dietary and environmental factors.

## Methodology

- **Subjects:** Male Wistar rats
- **Groups:** Control, High Fat Diet, BPA, High Fat Diet + BPA
- **Procedures:** Dietary administration, BPA exposure, tissue collection, histological analysis
- **Analysis:** Microscopy, image analysis, statistical evaluation

```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cerebellum-hfd-bpa.git
   ```
2. Review the `docs/` folder for detailed methodology and protocols.
3. Use the scripts in `scripts/` for data analysis.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (for analysis scripts)
- R (optional, for statistical analysis)
- ImageJ/Fiji (for image processing)

## Results

Key findings and summary of results will be presented in the `docs/results.md` file.
